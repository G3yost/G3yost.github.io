    <canvas id="gameWorld" tabindex="1" width="512" height="480" style="border: 1px solid brown; background: lightskyblue"></canvas>
    <p style="color: white">To play/demo focus the game canvas by clicking on it. When focused you can use a & d for lateral movement, and spacebar for jumping. The game world loops left to right to provide more "space" without scrolling.</p>
    <p style="color: white">This SOMEWHAT emulates an original SMB1 feel with movement & jumping with a higher jump when held and a skid to a stop when pushing in the direction opposite of your velocity. (tapping the other direction can help extend the length this is played so it's more obvious). The canvas is 512x480 and sprite is doubled in size to emulate the original render scale of 256x240.
