      On June 25th 2007 I was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma. This is a rare
      form of bone cancer typically only found in 10-20 year olds. This image is
      mirrored to reflect that the tumor was on the right side. You can click on
      any of the images for full images of the X-ray/Bone scan/CAT scan.

    <p class="historiesLeftParagraph">
      For the next 4 months I was treated with # individual rounds of
      chemotherapy I was brought in for surgery to remove the tumor. This
      surgery removed 3 of my ribs, 4-6, from spine to armpit. These were
      replaced with a <strong>VEPTR</strong>, <strong>V</strong>ertical,
      <strong>E</strong>xtensible, <strong>P</strong>rosthetic,
      <strong>T</strong>itanium, <strong>R</strong>ib. This prosthetic is
      clamped onto ribs 3 and 7 spanning the vertical gap. It also has titainum
      wires wrapped around and inserted into the remaining rib sections to
      emulate the ribs. Additionally a section of Gortex was added to strengthen
      the chest wall. Following this surgery I had another # chemotherapy
      treatments bringing the total up to 14 to total rounds. On March 1st 2008
      I finished my last chemo treatment.

    <p class="historiesRightParagraph">
      My life after treatment has been affected somewhat by physical problems
      with my prosthetics and generally missing multiple ribs. One of the things
      I did very quickly was break all of the wires in my back. Some of these
      segments were removed due to them painfully poking me. They have since
      stopped using wires with this style of reconstruction.

      In freshman year of high school I was diagnosed with scoliosis, excessive
      spine curvature. I had approximately a (DEGREE) bend in my spine. The fix
      for this is a spinal fusion This is where metal rods are attached to the
      spine, and bone is packed into the surrounding area of the main vertebrae
      to allow the spine to grow its self into one chunk rather than individual
      articulating parts. Mine was from vertebrae ### - ###, this distance is
      relatively stiff in even "normal" people so this hasn't affected my range
      of motion to much.

    <p class="historiesParagraph">
      During the summer of 2015 between High School and College I and four other
      students formed a company, Sharp Synaptics, which had the goal of making
      apps to help people with Aphasia, a mental condition common after strokes.
      We started with an app that would help to speak for them. This was a great
      learning experience in a large number of ways and I would recommend it to
      anyone who is interesting in working with code. We all learned how to use
      version control, Git, work with each other over Slack, use a Kanban, and
      actually make apps.

      This was my first "Real job" if you will, I had previous positions as an
      intern at the Tacoma Public Library, and an office assistant a friends
      company for a few months. While I was there I was responsible for data
      management. This meant that I got the data: 3d models, drawings, parts
      lists, and other information needed to make parts for our clients. This
      had a variety of requirements and a particular process that was relatively
      consistent. This meant that I could automate the task quite readily using
      AutoHotKey. After making my tools I could download new data and convert it
      at about 4 times the speed as I could without and for data that wasn't new
      but needed to be downloaded and save none the less moved from being 1.5
      per minute to about 6 per minute of unique files, and 40 per minute of
      duplicate files. My tool also made far fewer mistakes than I would due to
      the inability for my tool to misspell file names or locations. My tool
      helped me get through over 30,000 files in 6 weeks brining the back log
      down to zero.

      In the winter 2019 quarter while I was at
      <strong id="huskies">UWT</strong> I wanted to start a gun club. After a
      few weeks of recruiting and paper work I started an RSO, Registered
      Student Organization, and we have held meetings throughout the Spring 2019
      quarter. I have been the President of the club since inception and I plan
      to be until I graduate at the end of Spring 2020. My goals with this club
      were to get people who like firearms in any capacity to come and meet ever
      few weeks and have a range day every month so that fellow students at
      <strong id="huskies">UWT</strong> have an opportunity to learn about guns
      in a controlled environment.

    <p class="historiesParagraph">
      During the summer between Junior and Senior years of school at the
      <strong id="huskies">University of Washington Tacoma</strong> I worked at
      Arrow Electronics in Denver CO, for a summer IT internship. I mostly did
      Business intelligence dashboards. This means that I needed to make shiny,
      fancy, flashy pages for people to interpret data about Arrow that is not
      mine to share. To do this I used QlikSense and PowerBI. Each of these have
      their own quirks and helped me to use my "Excel" function knowledge and
      learn more of them. In additions to my regular job there all of the
      interns were put into groups and were tasked with a different task that is
      Arrow only info, though I can say that my team came in ## of ## teams.
