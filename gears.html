            In June of 2019, Scott Urban launched another kick starter for
            <strong>IRPair</strong> and <strong>Phantom</strong> glasses. These
            both incorporate IR blocking lenses that foil Facial Recognition.
            IRPair come in a variety of colors, and the Phantoms come in IR only
            retro reflective black, this is the set that I have on order.

            I am basically wearing a hoodie all the time. I am not a fan of sun
            directly on my skin, it feels warm compared to the additional temp
            from the extra hoodie layer. I also usually get that kangaroo pocket
            on the front for bonus holding stuff which can be helpful.

            This is the current phone I have. It's a piece of shit, but it gets
            all the stuff I want done with it done. I'm currently using
            <strong>ParanoidOS</strong> rather than the version of Android that
            came on it because Motorola had some dumb bloat ware on it and was
            less customizable.

            This is my smart watch. It's pretty much only useful to me as a
            fitness tracker, notification reader, timer/stop watch, and normal
            watch. If you want this watch I would advise getting a better band
            than the rubber one that comes with it because that one is kinda
            fragile.

            This is my EDC med kit, in it I have chest seals, QuikClot gauze,
            medical shears, and a CAT-7 Tourniquet. I would recommend that
            everyone have some kind of medical training and carry medical gear
            with them. It doesn't need to be nearly as trauma focused as this,
            but some kind of medical gear is very rarely a bad thing.

            Why buy a Glock when you can make your own? Well the Glock probably
            works more consistently, or at least more consistently than my
            P80... Whatever this is my striker fire gun. It still needs some
            more rounds through it before I want to bring it to competition.
            It's not quite smooth at the moment.

            This is literally the 2nd piece of gear that I bought. They work,
            no they are not super speedy race gear, but they actually hold onto
            your mags while you do dumb shit like run and jump and roll around
            even without the retention Velcro which is redundant in my
            experience.

            Wow look they go on my plate carrier and hold 3 PMags... They do the
            job, they hold the mags, they are durable. As far as I can tell it's
            either these or HSGI Tacos for pouches that stay open without a mag
            in them. If you have a different piece of gear send me an email and
            I will look into them.

            Small</strong> plates and has a few extra bits, mostly the zip on
            back plate things, that are more attractive than the other carriers.
            If someone wants to make me a <strong>SAPI Extra Small</strong>
            carrier PLEASE contact me because the only one I found is over

            Do you still want updates from Microsoft, so you have Windows 10
            installed, but you hate the aesthetics and function of parts? No
            problem go get Classic Shell. I only really use the start menu
            portion, but there are some pretty cool tools hidden in there.

            Do you like Chineseium? Do you also want to cram some of that shit
            into the windows file explorer? Well I have and it's pretty slick.
            Clover adds chrome style tabs to explorer. Very useful for me.

            My plain text editor. It's got some syntax highlighting, but the
            multi-cursor function is the real reason why I like Sublime.

            The keyboard is the most useful tool I have for dealing with my
            computer, so rather than put up with the ones you can buy I made my
            own. Mainly with Cherry MX Blues, I also have Clears and Browns on
            specific keys. The reprogramability and robust nature of key
            combinations that can be made using just the EZ Configurator is
            insane, and that is without any tweaking in QMK or TMK.

            Wires are annoying when you wanna whip your hand across your desk
            quickly and the best version of a wireless mouse that existed at the
            time was the Mamba 2012. If I had one thing to improve it would be
            Razer Synapse. Razer should stick to hardware design and outsource
            EVERY SINGLE LINE OF CODE to somewhere else.

            I really like track balls for laptop use and desktop browsing. I
            started out with the <strong>Logitech m570</strong> and eventually
            wore out the buttons like many users of those mice do. I then
            stumbled upon what I would consider to be a strict upgrade and a
            much better design. I have broken one however because I dropped it
            and it then got run over by a van when I was on my way to a friends
            how to do a group project.

            A pretty decent set of headphones that I use when gaming. Go listen
            to some headphones with the same source and pick the ones you want.
            I bought these for gaming, not for music so the audio curve is
            pretty flat.

            These are the headphones I have mounted to my Vive. They are open
            back so that I can give clear instructions to the person that is
            playing and they can still hear the game. Hey they were like $45 on
            Massdrop at the time so I thought what the hell.

            I picked up my Vive used for 500 bucks in 2017 so that I could play
            Pavlov and Beat Saber. It's a good time if you have the space to
            flail your arms and be a derp. I would recommend at least trying VR
            once, however having a good guide is very helpful for a good time.
            Solid introductory games include: The Lab, Beat Saber, and Tilt
            Brush.
